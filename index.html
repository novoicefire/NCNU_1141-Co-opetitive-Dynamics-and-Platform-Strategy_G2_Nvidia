CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is the main foundation of this ecosystem, a parallel computing platform that has become the industry standard for developing AI (Artificial Intelligence) and HPC (High Performance Computing) applications, and used by millions of developers worldwide.",
                                                "This transformation creates a form of network effects: the developers use CUDA → the stronger the attraction of NVIDIA GPUs → and the higher switching cost for moving to a competitor's platform. This statement is also reflected in the company's official documents, which position NVIDIA as a full-stack computing company with a focus on AI and accelerated computing.",
                                                "Besides CUDA, the expansion of services such as NVIDIA DGX Cloud and NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud represents that NVIDIA U.S is moving toward a multi-sided platform business model, serving developers, enterprises, cloud providers, and industries such as automotive and manufacturing. Through the integration of premium hardware (H100, A100) and proprietary software stack, NVIDIA manages the platform's governance with a balance of 'open yet controlled' – developers are free to access tools and SDKs, but the core technology remains under NVIDIA's control."

                                                "• Threat of new entrants is LOW because potential new players would need to compete not only at the hardware level but also build a software ecosystem, tools, libraries, and a developer community. This is a barrier that NVIDIA has built over more than a decade through CUDA and its supporting infrastructure.",
                                                "• Bargaining power of suppliers is MODERATE, as the semiconductor supply chain is highly complex but NVIDIA's scale and strategic relationships minimize this pressure.",
                                                "• Bargaining power of buyers is MODERATE TO HIGH, as big tech companies purchase GPUs in large quantities while simultaneously developing their own internal AI chips. Recent industry reports highlight a trend in which cloud companies seek GPU alternatives as a long-term efficiency measure.",
                                                "• Threat of substitutes is MODERATE TO HIGH, due to the development of specialized AI chips such as TPUs (Tensor Processing Unit) and Trainium designed to optimize specific workloads. However, these substitutes still face challenges related to software compatibility and ecosystem limitations, allowing NVIDIA's dominance to persist.",
                                                "• Rivalry among competitors is COMPLEX because many competitors are also partners and customers.

These are critical components for maintaining growing network effects and keeping the risk of multi-homing low.",
                                                "Furthermore, the PM must understand the dynamics of co-opetition because NVIDIA's main partners (AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure) are simultaneously developing their own accelerators. This means the PM must strategize compelling value propositions – for instance, through superior performance, platform stability, cloud integration, or advanced simulation capabilities – so that partners remain dependent on NVIDIA's platform even when they have internal alternatives. The PM's decisions in this case are crucial for maintaining the appropriate balance between openness and control in the platform ecosystem."
